# Project 15: Unit Testing - "TestMyCode"

## 🎯 Objective
Build a **Shopping Cart** system and write comprehensive JUnit 5 unit tests
for it. This project teaches you TDD (Test-Driven Development) — write
tests FIRST, then implement the code to make them pass!

## 📚 Topics Covered (from Study Material)
- JUnit 5 (assertions, annotations, parameterized tests)
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) — Red-Green-Refactor
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Positive and negative testing
- Edge cases and boundary values
- FIRST principles (Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely)
