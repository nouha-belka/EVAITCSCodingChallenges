# ============================================================================
# GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
# TOPIC: Automated build, test, and deploy on every push
# ============================================================================
#
# This pipeline runs on every push to main:
#   1. Build and test the Spring Boot backend
#   2. Build the React frontend
#   3. Build Docker images
#   4. (Optional) Deploy to AWS
#
# INTERVIEW TIP:
# "I set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD. On every push, it runs tests,
#  builds Docker images, and can deploy to AWS automatically."
