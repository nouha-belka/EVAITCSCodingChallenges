# Project 09: OOP Advanced - "BuildMyCompanySystem"

## 🎯 Objective
Build a **Company Organization System** using advanced OOP concepts:
Composition, Enums, Records, and Serialization.
These are the concepts that separate junior developers from mid-level developers!

## 📚 Topics Covered (from Study Material)
- Composition ("has-a" relationships)
- Enums (fixed sets of constants)
- Records (immutable data classes, Java 14+)
- Serialization (saving objects to files)
