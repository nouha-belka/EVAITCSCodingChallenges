# Project 14: Multithreading - "BuildMyTaskProcessor"

## 🎯 Objective
Build a **Task Processing System** that executes multiple tasks concurrently
using Java's multithreading capabilities. You'll learn to create threads,
use ExecutorService, handle synchronization, and avoid common pitfalls!

## 📚 Topics Covered (from Study Material)
- Extending Thread class
- Implementing Runnable interface
- Callable with return values
- ExecutorService and thread pools
- Synchronization and thread safety
- volatile keyword
