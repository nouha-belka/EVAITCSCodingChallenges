# Project 01: Project Planning Phase - "PlanMyApp"

## 🎯 Objective
You are a junior developer who has just been asked to plan a **Student Grade Tracker** application.
Your manager wants to see a complete project plan BEFORE any code is written.
This is exactly what happens in real companies — planning comes first!

## 📚 Topics Covered (from Study Material)
- Requirements Analysis
- SMART Objectives
- Stakeholder Management
- Timeline Development (WBS)
- Resource Estimation
- Risk Assessment

## 📝 Tasks to Complete

### Task 1: Requirements Analysis (requirements.md)
Create a file called `requirements.md` and answer the following:

1. **Business Needs:** What problem does a Student Grade Tracker solve? List at least 5 needs.
2. **Project Objectives:** Write 3 SMART objectives for this application.
   - Example: "The system shall allow teachers to enter grades for up to 200 students within 2 seconds per entry by March 2026."
3. **Stakeholders:** Identify at least 4 stakeholders (who uses or is affected by the system?).
4. **Features List:** List at least 8 features the application should have.

### Task 2: Risk Assessment (risk-assessment.md)
Create a file called `risk-assessment.md` with a risk table:

| Risk | Probability (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Risk Score | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| Example: Database crashes | 2 | 5 | 10 | Daily backups, failover DB |
| (Add at least 5 more risks) | | | | |

### Task 3: Timeline & Work Breakdown Structure (timeline.md)
Create a file called `timeline.md`:

1. Break the project into **phases** (e.g., Design, Development, Testing, Deployment).
2. For each phase, list **specific tasks**.
3. Estimate **time** for each task.
4. Identify **dependencies** (what must be done before what?).

Example format:
```
Phase 1: Design (Week 1-2)
  - Task 1.1: Create database schema (2 days) - No dependencies
  - Task 1.2: Design UI wireframes (3 days) - No dependencies
  - Task 1.3: Write API specifications (2 days) - Depends on 1.1

Phase 2: Development (Week 3-6)
  - Task 2.1: Set up project structure (1 day) - Depends on Phase 1
  ...
```

### Task 4: Resource Planning (resources.md)
Create a file called `resources.md`:

1. **Human Resources:** What roles are needed? (e.g., Frontend Dev, Backend Dev, QA Tester)
2. **Technical Resources:** What tools/software are needed?
3. **Budget Estimate:** Create a rough cost estimate table.

## 💡 Interview Tip
In technical interviews, you may be asked: *"How would you approach planning a new project?"*
This exercise gives you a real answer with concrete examples to discuss!

## 🏆 Bonus Challenge
Create a one-page **Executive Summary** (`executive-summary.md`) that summarizes your entire plan
in a format suitable for presenting to a non-technical stakeholder.
