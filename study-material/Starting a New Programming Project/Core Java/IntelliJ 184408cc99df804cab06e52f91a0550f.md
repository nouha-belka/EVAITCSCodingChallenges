# Creating Your First Maven Project in IntelliJ - A Student Guide

## Introduction

Maven is a powerful build tool that helps manage your Java project's dependencies and build process. When you create a Maven project, you're setting up a standardized way to organize your code and manage external libraries that your project might need. Let's walk through creating your first Maven project.

## Creating Your Project

### Initial Setup Steps

Start by creating a new project in IntelliJ:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Click "New Project" (or File → New → Project)
3. In the new project window, configure these settings:
    - Select "Java" from the left sidebar
    - Enter a meaningful project name (this will be your project's folder name)
    - Choose your project location
    - Under "Build system", select "Maven"
    - For JDK, select your installed JDK (e.g., corretto-17)
    - Check "Add sample code" to create a starter Main class
    - You can leave "Create Git repository" unchecked for now
4. Click "Create"

### Understanding What Maven Created

When your project opens, you'll notice Maven has created a specific directory structure:

```
your-project-name/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/        # Your application code goes here
│   │   └── resources/   # Configuration files go here
│   └── test/
│       ├── java/        # Your test code goes here
│       └── resources/   # Test configuration files go here
├── pom.xml              # Maven's configuration file
└── .idea/               # IntelliJ's configuration files

```

### The POM File - Your Project's Blueprint

Open the `pom.xml` file. This is Maven's configuration file, and you'll see something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="<http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0>"
         xmlns:xsi="<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance>"
         xsi:schemaLocation="<http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0> <http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd>">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>org.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>your-project-name</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <properties>
        <maven.compiler.source>17</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.target>17</maven.compiler.target>
        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
    </properties>

</project>

```

Let's understand each part:

- `groupId`: Think of this as your project's family name. It's usually your organization's reversed domain name
- `artifactId`: This is your project's specific name
- `version`: Tracks your project's version number. SNAPSHOT means it's still in development
- The `properties` section sets up Java version and character encoding

### Creating Your First Class

1. In the Project Explorer, expand the `src` folder
2. Navigate to `src/main/java`
3. Right-click → New → Java Class
4. Name it "Main"
5. Add a simple main method:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Maven!");
    }
}

```

### Running Your Program

You can run your program in two ways:

1. Click the green play button next to your main method
2. Right-click the Main class in the Project Explorer and select "Run 'Main.main()'"

## Understanding the Maven Tool Window

On the right side of IntelliJ, you'll see the Maven tool window (if not visible, go to View → Tool Windows → Maven). This window shows:

1. Your project name
2. Lifecycle commands like:
    - `clean`: Removes compiled files
    - `compile`: Compiles your code
    - `test`: Runs your tests
    - `package`: Creates a JAR file of your project

Double-clicking any of these commands executes them.

## Writing Your First Test

Let's create a simple test to see how Maven handles testing:

1. Navigate to `src/test/java`
2. First, add JUnit to your `pom.xml` inside the `<project>` tag:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
        <version>5.9.2</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

```

1. Create a test class:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class MainTest {
    @Test
    void simpleTest() {
        assertTrue(true, "This test should always pass");
    }
}

```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Maven Changes Not Taking Effect

If you make changes to your `pom.xml`:

1. Look for a small popup asking to reload the Maven project
2. Or click the "Reload All Maven Projects" button (circular arrows) in the Maven tool window

### "Cannot resolve symbol" Errors

If you see red underlines in your code:

1. Right-click the project
2. Select Maven → Reload project

### Build Failed

If your build fails:

1. Check the error message in the "Run" tool window
2. Ensure your JDK version matches what's in your `pom.xml`
3. Try Maven → clean, then Maven → compile

## Next Steps

Now that you have your Maven project set up, you can:

1. Add more dependencies to your `pom.xml`
2. Create more classes and organize them into packages
3. Write unit tests for your code
4. Learn about Maven's build lifecycle and goals

Remember: The `pom.xml` file is where you'll add external libraries your project needs. Each time you modify it, Maven will automatically download and manage those dependencies for you.
