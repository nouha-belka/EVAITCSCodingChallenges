# Enums

# Understanding Java Enums

Enums (short for enumerations) were introduced in Java 5.0 (JDK 1.5) as a new type that represents a fixed set of constants. Before enums, developers had to use static final constants to represent fixed sets of values.

## Historical Context

Before Java 5.0, developers typically used integer constants to represent fixed sets of values:

```java
public class OldWay {
    public static final int SMALL = 1;
    public static final int MEDIUM = 2;
    public static final int LARGE = 3;
}
```

This approach had several drawbacks:

- No type safety - could pass any integer where these constants were expected
- No namespace - constants could clash with other integer constants
- No easy way to print meaningful names - toString() had to be manually implemented
- No way to iterate through all values

## Basic Enum Usage

Here's a basic enum declaration:

```java
public enum Size {
    SMALL,
    MEDIUM,
    LARGE
}

// Usage
Size mySize = Size.MEDIUM;
```

## Advanced Enum Features

Enums can have fields, constructors, and methods:

```java
public enum Planet {
    MERCURY(3.303e+23, 2.4397e6),
    VENUS(4.869e+24, 6.0518e6),
    EARTH(5.976e+24, 6.37814e6);

    private final double mass;   // in kilograms
    private final double radius; // in meters
    
    Planet(double mass, double radius) {
        this.mass = mass;
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    
    public double getMass() {
        return mass;
    }
    
    public double getRadius() {
        return radius;
    }
}
```

## Enum Methods and Functionality

All enums automatically come with some useful methods:

- `values()` - Returns an array of all enum values
- `valueOf(String name)` - Returns the enum constant with the specified name
- `name()` - Returns the name of the enum constant
- `ordinal()` - Returns the position of the enum constant (0-based)

Example using enum methods:

```java
public enum Direction {
    NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST;
    
    // Custom method
    public Direction opposite() {
        switch(this) {
            case NORTH: return SOUTH;
            case SOUTH: return NORTH;
            case EAST:  return WEST;
            case WEST:  return EAST;
            default:    return null;
        }
    }
}

// Usage
Direction[] allDirections = Direction.values();
Direction north = Direction.NORTH;
Direction south = north.opposite();
```

## Best Practices

- Use enums when you have a fixed set of constants
- Keep enum constants in UPPERCASE
- Consider using enums instead of integer constants
- Make fields final to ensure immutability
- Use enums to implement the Singleton pattern when appropriate

Enums are type-safe, provide namespace protection, and are much more powerful than the old integer constants approach. They are an essential feature in modern Java programming.
