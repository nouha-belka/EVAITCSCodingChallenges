# Week 5 Project

# Library Management System

Create a library management system that integrates the core Week 4 concepts: JDBC, File I/O, and Unit Testing, with optional Multithreading implementation for bonus points.

## Core Requirements:

### 1. Database Integration (JDBC)

- Implement CRUD operations for books, members, and loans
- Create database connections using connection pooling
- Handle transaction management for book checkouts and returns

### 2. File Operations (File I/O)

- Import/export book catalog as CSV files
- Generate transaction reports as text files
- Implement logging system for all operations

### 3. Quality Assurance (Unit Testing)

- Write unit tests for all core functionalities
- Implement integration tests for database operations
- Create mock objects for external dependencies

## Optional Enhancement (Bonus Points):

### 4. Concurrent Operations (Multithreading)

- Handle multiple user requests simultaneously
- Implement background tasks for report generation
- Create a scheduled task system for overdue book notifications

## Deliverables:

1. Source code with proper documentation
2. Database schema and sample data
3. Unit test suite with minimum 80% coverage
4. User guide for system operation
5. Project presentation demonstrating all features

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Proper implementation of required concepts (JDBC, File I/O, Unit Testing)
- Code quality and organization
- Error handling and system robustness
- Documentation completeness
- Test coverage and quality
- Bonus points for successful Multithreading implementation
