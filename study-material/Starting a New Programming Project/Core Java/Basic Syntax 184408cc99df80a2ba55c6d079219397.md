# Core Java Syntax Guide

## Variables and Data Types

Variables in Java are used to store data. They must be declared with a specific type before use.

```java
// Variable declaration examples
int number = 5;
String name = "Alice";
double price = 10.5;
```

## Basic Operations

- **Arithmetic Operations:** Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)
- **Comparison Operations:** Equal to (==), Not equal to (!=), Greater than (>), Less than (<)
- **Logical Operations:** AND (&&), OR (||), NOT (!)

## Control Structures

Java uses control structures to manage program flow:

```java
// If-else statement
if (condition) {
    // code block
} else {
    // code block
}

// For loop
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // code block
}

// While loop
while (condition) {
    // code block
}
```

## Comments

Java supports single-line and multi-line comments:

```java
// This is a single-line comment

/* This is a
   multi-line comment */
```

## Functions/Methods

Methods in Java must be declared with return type and parameter types:

```java
public int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Follow proper indentation
- Include appropriate comments
- Declare variables with appropriate data types
