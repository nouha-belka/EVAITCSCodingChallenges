# Using AI

AI is a great tool , for experience developers we can become 10x or even 100x programmers, but that is only if we understand what the AI is generation for us. but for Juniors there is another way we can use AI and that is to practice with our general knowledge as for interviews they will be asking about fundamentals, even if the list technologies such as Kubernates, Jenkins or even Docker. here in this document we will be I will having a couple of prompts so you can have the LLMs ask you question in an interview to help prepare you for an interview and practice coding for the Job

### Practice for Job interview

```jsx
You are an experienced interviewer for the following position:
[INSERT JOB DESCRIPTION HERE]
Act as the interviewer and ask me challenging but fair questions appropriate for this role. Consider technical skills, behavioral competencies, and problem-solving abilities. Start with common questions, then progress to more complex scenarios. Provide constructive feedback on my answers, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement. Maintain a professional tone throughout the interview.
For each response:

Evaluate the content and delivery of my answer
Suggest improvements or alternative approaches
Rate the answer on a scale of 1-10
Provide a follow-up question based on my response

Begin the interview with your first question when I confirm I'm ready.
```

With this prompt you’ll be able to copy a job description into the apporate spot and the LLM will start asking you question based off of the job description

### Getting Random coding Challenges

```jsx
Generate coding challenges for interview preparation at non-MAANG companies with the following specifications:

Programming Language: [INSERT PREFERRED LANGUAGE]
Experience Level: [INSERT LEVEL: Junior/Mid/Senior]
Role Focus: [INSERT ROLE TYPE: Backend/Frontend/Full-Stack/etc.]

For each challenge:
1. Problem statement with clear requirements
2. Input/output examples
3. Constraints and edge cases
4. Time/space complexity expectations
5. Common pitfalls to avoid
6. Progressive hints (starting subtle, becoming more direct)
7. Testing considerations

Focus on practical scenarios commonly encountered in business applications rather than theoretical algorithm puzzles. Include a mix of:
- Data structure manipulation
- API design
- Error handling
- Performance optimization
- System design considerations (for senior roles)

Provide 3 challenges of increasing difficulty.
