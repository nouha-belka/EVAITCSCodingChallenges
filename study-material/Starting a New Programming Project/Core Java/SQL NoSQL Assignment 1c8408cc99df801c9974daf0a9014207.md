# SQL/NoSQL Assignment

# SQL and NoSQL Database Assignment

This assignment will help you understand the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases through practical implementation.

## Part 1: SQL Implementation (50%)

Create a small library database system using MySQL with the following requirements:

- **Database Design:**
    - Create tables for books, authors, and borrowers
    - Implement proper relationships between tables
    - Apply appropriate indexing strategies
- **CRUD Operations:**
    - Write queries to perform basic CRUD operations
    - Implement at least one stored procedure
    - Create queries demonstrating JOIN operations
- **Data Integrity:**
    - Implement ACID properties
    - Use transactions where appropriate
    - Apply proper constraints and validations

## Part 2: NoSQL Implementation (50%)

Implement the same library system using MongoDB to understand the differences:

- **Document Design:**
    - Design appropriate document structure
    - Implement nested documents where suitable
    - Consider data access patterns
- **Basic Operations:**
    - Implement CRUD operations in MongoDB
    - Demonstrate document querying capabilities
    - Show how to handle relationships in NoSQL

## Deliverables

- SQL database schema and implementation code
- NoSQL database structure and implementation code
- Documentation explaining your design decisions
- Comparison report highlighting the pros and cons of each approach

## Evaluation Criteria

- Proper implementation of database concepts (30%)
- Code quality and organization (25%)
- Documentation clarity (25%)
- Design decisions and reasoning (20%)

Remember to implement proper error handling and follow database best practices throughout your implementation.
