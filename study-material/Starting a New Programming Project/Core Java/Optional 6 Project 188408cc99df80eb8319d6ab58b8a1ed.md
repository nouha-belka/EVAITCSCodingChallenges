# Optional 6 Project

# Final Project: Student Management System

Build a console-based Student Management System that demonstrates your understanding of core Java concepts. This project will integrate various topics covered throughout the course.

## Required Features:

- **Database Integration (JDBC)**
    - Create tables for students, courses, and grades
    - Implement CRUD operations
    - Use prepared statements for security
- **Object-Oriented Design**
    - Create appropriate classes (Student, Course, Grade)
    - Implement inheritance and polymorphism
    - Apply encapsulation principles
    - Use interfaces where appropriate
- **Collections**
    - Use appropriate collection types to store data
    - Implement sorting and filtering
    - Demonstrate use of Generics
- **Exception Handling**
    - Custom exceptions for business logic
    - Proper error handling and user feedback
    - Resource management

## Optional Advanced Features:

- **File I/O**
    - Import/Export data to files
    - Log system operations
- **Multithreading**
    - Background data backup
    - Concurrent database operations

## Main Menu Requirements:
