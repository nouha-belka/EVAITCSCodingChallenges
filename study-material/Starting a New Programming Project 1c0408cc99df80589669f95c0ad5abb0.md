        - Easier to develop and deploy
        - Simpler testing process
    - Microservices Architecture
        - Better scalability
        - Independent deployment
        - Technology flexibility
    - Serverless Architecture
        - Cost-effective
        - Auto-scaling
        - Focus on business logic
- Database Design
    
    Key concepts to master:
    
    - Relational vs NoSQL databases
    - Data modeling techniques
    - Normalization principles
    - Indexing strategies
    - Query optimization

## 3. Development Environment Setup

- Version Control System (Git)
    
    Essential Git concepts and commands:
    
    ```bash
    # Initialize repository
    git init
    
    # Basic commands
    git add .
    git commit -m "message"
    git push origin main
    
    # Branching
    git branch feature/new-feature
    git checkout -b feature/new-feature
    ```
    
- IDE Configuration
    - Choose appropriate IDE for your stack
    - Install essential extensions
    - Set up code formatting rules
    - Configure debugging tools
